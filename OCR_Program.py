# =========================================================================== #
'''
Program for converting image files with text in them into text as a .txt format
or other format with the text also displayed in the program interface. Comments
are attempted to be written in accordance with PEP 8 Style Guide:

class OCR:
    '''Class for carrying out Optical Character Recognition functions.

    Class within which all of the OCR tools reside. Receives image input and 
    first tries to identify text within the image. If no text is found, the 
    'image clean-up' process is called, converting the image to black and white
    and enlarging in small incriments. The conversion is then re-tried.
