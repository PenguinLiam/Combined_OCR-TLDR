# Combined_OCR-TLDR
A-Level Coursework to create my software to read text from an image and then summarise the text based on user needs

Run from main program. Folders named: Summaries, OCR_Conversions, and OCR_Images must be created. Tesseract must be installed from:
- https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
... or using PIP install pytesseract

The program does not work perfectly and is still incomplete...
